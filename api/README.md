### Generation Process

1. When we generate a topic we create database entries for all of the information above
2. We also generated a list of related topics. These are stored in the topics table but **without** a description or related topics of its own
3. **As a result, our topics table contains some topics with descriptions and some without**
4. When we visit the page of a topic without a description, we need to generate its description on the fly, at this time we also generate its related topics in turn, continuing the cycle

### Slug

For each topic we also need to generate a slug from the name.
